breakout-solution project

The breakout-lab code creates the breakout game, but without any bricks.
The lab class exercise (with tutor support) is to add a row of bricks and make them
disappear when the ball hits them. 

breakout-solution includes the code to do this

The assessment project uses breakout-solution as the starting point for adding
new features as discussed in lectures and seminars. Tutors may not help directly 
with this but will talk you through examples and answer questions.
